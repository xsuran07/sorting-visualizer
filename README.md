# Sorting algoritms visualization

React application which visualize basic sorting algorithms. It is fully responsive. Skeleton of the application
has been generated with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). Currently, following algorithms are supported:

- Selection sort (O(N^2))
- Bubble sort (O(N^2))
- Insertion sort (O(N^2))
- Merge sort (O(N * log(N)))
- Heap sort (O(N * log(N)))
- Quick sort (O(N * log(N)))
